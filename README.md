Project exam second year FED at Noroff. 

## Project Description
Bid Boutique is a dynamic auction website where users can list items for auction and place bids on items listed by others. This front-end interface connects with an API to provide a seamless user experience for both registered and unregistered users. The platform starts every new user with 1000 credits, enabling them to participate actively from day one. This project was developed as part of our coursework at Noroff School of Technology and Digital Media.

## User Features
* Registration and Authentication: Users with a valid "stud.noroff.no" email can register, login, and logout of the system.
* Profile Management: Users can update their avatars, bio and banner image and view their credit totals on their profile.
* Listing Creation: Registered users can create listings with titles, deadlines, media galleries, and descriptions.
* Bidding on Listings: Users can place bids on listings created by others and view all bids placed on a listing.
* Search Functionality: Allows both registered and unregistered users to search through listings.

## Tech Used
* HTML, CSS, JavaScript: Core technologies for building the front-end interface.
* ChatGPT: Used for debugging and assistance during development.
* Figma: For designing wireframes and high-fidelity assets.
* FontAwesome: For incorporating icons into the interface.
* Google Fonts: For typography and enhancing the visual appeal.
* Youtube: For inspiration and tips for various of challenges during the project.

## Challenges Faced
1. Complex API Interactions: Integrating complex auction and bidding functionalities using the API was challenging but provided valuable experience with real-world applications.
2. Search and Filtering with Pagination: Implementing a seamless search and filtering system that works in conjunction with pagination proved to be a complex task. It required maintaining the state across page transitions and ensuring the API could handle combined queries efficiently.


## Future Features
For further development of this blog, I would like to add folloging features:
* Advanced Search Filters: To enable users to filter listings by more specific criteria.
* Add Favourites page.
